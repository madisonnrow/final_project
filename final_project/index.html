    <h1>Madison's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Showcasing my projects and works from the fall semester of my Intro to Digital Studio Practice ART2602C class. There were seven projects that were worked on this semester that will be highlighted on this page. Each one was fun and creative, teaching me more about the art programs I work with. My approach with these projects was to go with what I know from taking a previous class with my professor and applying it here. I found some of the projects challenging and they definitely gave me some issues. However, I managed to overcome the problems I had, taking care to learn and understand what the issues were. I have learned a lot more about certain programs like Photoshop, as I did not know you could make GIFs or animations with the program. This semester broadened my understanding of HTML coding and coding using p5.js. By the end of this semester, I feel more confident with my abilities to code websites with HTML.</p>

    <section id="pixelated">
      <h2>Pixelated</h2>
      <p>This project was to use Photoshop to make a series of pixelated images. Using Photoshop, I would take free images I found online, crop them, and mess with the index color function. Each image was cropped to a certain size based on the assignment directions.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge I had with this assignment was trying to find images that were interesting. I went through many photos, trying to picture in my head what details I could focus on when cropping my images. I was not too worried about the images being too recognizable, but I also did want them to be pleasing on the eye whether they were recognizable or not. The process of cropping and messing with the color index was very simple. From this assignment, I learned a bit about making pixelated art in Photoshop. I have used the program many times before, but there is still a lot with it that I do not know, and this taught me some new ways to use it.</p>

    <section id="bad-photoshop">
      <h2>Bad Photoshop</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to make "bad" Photoshop composites influenced by the work of Lucas Blalock. Using Photoshop, I had to use different tools in the program to do this assignment. I would try to use one image for each composite, using the details from them to make my "bad" photoshop image.</p>
      <p>My challenge for this assignment was creating each image. I really struggled with designing each image, as I wanted my images to match that "bad" photoshop style like Blalock has. It was hard for me to look at my work and decide if I captured that style or not. My creative choice with this assignment was to use all the little things around my room. I wanted my images to take from my surroundings, so I wanted to make use of what I have. I have lots of little trinkets and objects that I felt would be good to work with, so I made use of them in my work. </p>

    <section id="perfect-mask">
      <h2>Perfect Mask</h2>
      <p>This project had us create "perfect mask" images inspired by John Baldessari's collages. We made these in Photoshop. Working on this, I would select my subject and apply a mask to it. Then, I picked colors to use for my mask that would stand out against the black and white image. I did the same thing for my second one, but that one masked the background instead.</p>
      <p>My challenge for this project was my desire for perfection. Especially with my two different colored masks. I wanted to be as close as possible with each person, so I went thoroughly through this project to make sure the masks lined up perfectly. The technique I learned from this assignment was swapping colors with "x" in Photoshop. Something very simple, but I had never known that trick before. My creative choice for this assignment was mainly with the wedding photo. I thought it would be a nice touch to have the man and woman blue and pink as a play on traditional boy and girl colors.</p>

    <section id="animated-gifs">
      <h2>Animated GIFs</h2>
      <p>The goal of these assignments was to use Photoshop to create animated GIFs. These were made with the video timeline panel in Photoshop. One was made to be a stop motion GIF, moving the character panel by panel. The other one was made to loop and flow seemlessly.</p>
      <p>The animated GIFs did not give me much trouble. I only had a little issue when I was doing the stop motion GIF, as my layers were wonky and I was confused about them. However, it was an easy fix, and I got it taken care of in no time. This whole assignment taught me a lot. I had never known that Photoshop had the ability to make GIFs, so I learned that. It also helped me learn the difference between making a seamless, looping GIF, and a stop motion GIF. With this assignment, I had decided to use images I had taken in that week, and chose a fun background for my stop motion.</p>

    <section id="glitch-n-grit">
      <h2>Glitch-n-Grit</h2>
      <p>This project was to create a three-page HTML site that explores the potential of low-resolution, distorted, and compressed images. This was made on Phoenix Code. I used Photoshop to create my images, using the checklist as my guides for what to create.</p>
      <p>My biggest challenge with this assignment was the writing portion, as well as creating the images. For the writing, I struggle with writing things in general. For the images, I felt as if there was not a lot of guidance for creating them. So when I created my images, I worried that I was not doing them correctly.  The overall concept of what the project wanted me to do was simple, but the writing and images made it a bit hard to make sure I had what I needed to include. I chose to make all my images for this project, as I wanted to show I knew and understood what was expected of me.</p>

    <section id="p5-js">
      <h2>p5-js</h2>
      <p>This project involved creating a self portrait and a landscape picture. We were to make this using the p5js website. I used a lot of shape coding to create both, as well as used the emoji coding for my landscape.</p>
      <p>For these assignments, I did not really struggle. I enjoy using p5js, so it was great to return to it. The technique I learned this time was that you could include emojis into it, as I did not know that before. My creative choice this time was mainly with the self portrait. I had to make a self portrait on this program before, and so I decided to challenge myself to see if I could make it better than my first one. I started by making the portrait similar to my first one, and then adapted it to be different and see if I could capture how I look now.</p>

    <section id="what-if">
      <h2>What If</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to take a concept/theme and create tokens with them. The theme I went with was "The Day the Moon Blinked." I used Google Docs to write my creative narrative, and I used Illustrator to create my icons. For my token icons, I used a shape tools to create moons with eyes, and I played with the different modes for colors to get a space creature feeling to it.</p>
      <p>My biggest struggle with this assignment was the creative writing portion. When I had chosen my theme I wanted to go with, I already had ideas in my head of how I wanted my tokens to look. However, with the included part of writing a creative narrative, I struggled. I did not really learn any new techniques when doing the assignment, however, I learned how to better use Illustrator earlier in the year. That helped me to create my tokens much easier, as I understood how to work the program a bit better. My creative choices in this assignment were to make my moon the eye of a space being, but I wanted to shroud the being in mystery. So I chose to give it no form, instead surrounding the moon with whisps of darkness to create a mysterious feel to it.</p>
